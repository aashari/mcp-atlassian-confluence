# MCP Atlassian Confluence Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Atlassian Confluence integration. This project will allow AI assistants like Claude Desktop and Cursor AI to access and interact with Atlassian Confluence content through the Model Context Protocol.

## About MCP

For detailed information about the Model Context Protocol (MCP), including core concepts, architecture, and implementation guides, please refer to the [official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/).

## Project Structure

This project is based on the boilerplate-mcp-server template and follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **`src/index.ts`**: Main entry point, initializes the MCP server or CLI based on arguments.
- **`src/controllers/`**: Business logic for operations.
- **`src/services/`**: External API integration.
- **`src/tools/`**: MCP tool definitions with Zod schemas.
- **`src/resources/`**: MCP resource definitions.
- **`src/cli/`**: CLI command definitions.
- **`src/utils/`**: Shared utilities.
- **`dist/`**: Compiled output (generated by `tsup`).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v22.14.0 or higher (specified in `.node-version` and `package.json`).
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js, used for package management.
- **Atlassian Confluence Access**: You'll need access to a Confluence instance and appropriate API credentials.
