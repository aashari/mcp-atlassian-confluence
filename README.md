# MCP Atlassian Confluence Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Atlassian Confluence integration. This project allows AI assistants like Claude Desktop and Cursor AI to access and interact with Atlassian Confluence content through the Model Context Protocol.

> **Note**: This project is forked from [boilerplate-mcp-server](https://github.com/aashari/boilerplate-mcp-server), a template for building MCP servers. It maintains compatibility with the boilerplate while adding Confluence-specific functionality.

## About MCP

For detailed information about the Model Context Protocol (MCP), including core concepts, architecture, and implementation guides, please refer to the [official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/).

## Fork Relationship

This project extends the boilerplate-mcp-server with Atlassian Confluence integration capabilities:

- **Base Functionality**: Preserves the IP address lookup functionality from the boilerplate as a reference implementation.
- **Added Features**: Adds Confluence API integration via the `fetchAtlassian` utility in `src/utils/transport.util.ts`.
- **Upstream Updates**: Maintains a remote connection to the boilerplate repository, allowing future improvements to be merged:
  ```bash
  # To pull in updates from the boilerplate
  git fetch boilerplate
  git merge boilerplate/main
  ```

## Project Structure

This project follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **`src/index.ts`**: Main entry point, initializes the MCP server or CLI based on arguments.
- **`src/controllers/`**: Business logic for operations.
- **`src/services/`**: External API integration.
- **`src/tools/`**: MCP tool definitions with Zod schemas.
- **`src/resources/`**: MCP resource definitions.
- **`src/cli/`**: CLI command definitions.
- **`src/utils/`**: Shared utilities, including `transport.util.ts` for Confluence API integration.
- **`dist/`**: Compiled output (generated by `tsup`).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v22.14.0 or higher (specified in `.node-version` and `package.json`).
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js, used for package management.
- **Atlassian Confluence Access**: You'll need access to a Confluence instance and appropriate API credentials.

## Installation

Install dependencies locally:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

### Building and Running

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Run the MCP server
npm start

# Run a CLI command
npm start -- get-ip-details 8.8.8.8
```

### Extending with Confluence Features

The project is designed to be extended with Confluence-specific functionality:

1. Use the `fetchAtlassian` utility in `src/utils/transport.util.ts` for API calls
2. Create new tools in `src/tools/` for Confluence operations
3. Add resources in `src/resources/` for Confluence content
4. Implement CLI commands in `src/cli/` for human interaction
