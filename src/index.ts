console.log('MCP Server - Starting up...');

// Basic TypeScript example to verify the setup works
const greet = (name: string): string => {
	return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

console.log(greet('World'));

// This is a minimal starter file
// You can expand this with MCP server implementation as needed
